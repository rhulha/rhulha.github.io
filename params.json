I still have great memories about the great editor and documentation!  \r\nFor my university I learned C and switched to it for my personal projects too since I liked the less verbose syntax over Pascal.  \r\nAlso for my University I learned Java 18 years ago which I love to this day.  \r\n  \r\nI like to say that Java is not perfect, but its damn close. :-)  \r\n  \r\nFor my effort to create a \"perfect\" language check out http://www.easy-lang.org  \r\n\r\n# My Github Projects:\r\n[https://github.com/rhulha](https://github.com/rhulha)\r\n\r\n# My Gists:\r\n\r\n- [SRT2VTT.java](https://gist.github.com/rhulha/3017fc640fee4b06e45847aae07f3376)\r\n- [TestMarkLogic.java](https://gist.github.com/rhulha/10e1489d12429b548bb4f5301953a809)\r\n- [TicTacToeUltraCompressed.java](https://gist.github.com/rhulha/8032bec1d3ae8e2c0818)\r\n- [SkypeChatLogParser.java](https://gist.github.com/rhulha/7154dfe3ad270e6f7282)\r\n- [deepCompare.java](https://gist.github.com/rhulha/255732567846bf4bef5b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
