I still have great memories about the great editor and documentation!\r\nFor my university I learned C and switched to it for my personal projects too since I liked the less verbose syntax over Pascal.  \r\nAlso for my University I learned Java 18 years ago which I love to this day.\r\n\r\nI like to say that, Java is not perfect, but it damn well is close. :-)\r\n\r\nFor my effort to create a \"perfect\" language check out http://www.easy-lang.org\r\n",
